# SpringSocialMedia

This Social media project is all about a user can login to the web application and add his/her post and edit or delete the post . Also he/she can add comment to their post  and edit or delete the comment.

In this project mainly focuses on Spring Boot, SpringBoot annotation usage and Spring API and also include advance api (validation, swagger,open api ,etc).

Using this project I can be more confident with my current work, also enhance my knowlegde which will be more worth to me as a software developer.

note : in future I can also inteegrate this project with microservices.
